# Tilesets 

NodeHack obtains the tiledata information from the (quite large) [tiles.json](./tiles.json) file. This file was created by parsing, in this order, [monsters.txt](./nethack/monsters.txt), [objects.txt](./nethack/objects.txt) and [other.txt](./nethack/other.txt) taken directly from the [NetHack source](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/tree/NetHack-3.6.2-beta01/win/share).
